```

- Falling into the void doesn't immediately kill you anymore.
- Instead, you're teleported to the location you fell from, and take 6 hearts of unblockable damage.
- This way, even if you die from falling into the void, your [player grave](^affogatotweaks:uncategorized/player_graves) will save your items and experience.
