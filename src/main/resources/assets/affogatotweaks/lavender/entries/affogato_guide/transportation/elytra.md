- **Fireworks no longer propel the Elytra.**
- Campfires now interact with the Elytra:
  - Crouch with the Elytra on a campfire to launch into the air
  - Flying over the campfire boosts you upward
- Increased Elytra durability.

New Elytra enchantments, incompatible with each other:

- **Smokestack**
- Crouching on campfires stores speed boosts which can be consumed with the space bar when flying.

- **Cloudskipper**
- Move faster and glide much longer when flying above the cloud layer.
