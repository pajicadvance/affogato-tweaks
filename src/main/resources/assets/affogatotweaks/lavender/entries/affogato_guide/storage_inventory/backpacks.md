- Backpacks are used to expand your inventory.
- They are equipped in their dedicated equipment slot (see [New Equipment Slots](^affogatotweaks:storage_inventory/new_equipment_slots)).
- You can only equip one backpack at a time. You cannot unequip a backpack unless it's empty.
- Press <keybind;key.inmis.open_backpack> to open the backpack.
