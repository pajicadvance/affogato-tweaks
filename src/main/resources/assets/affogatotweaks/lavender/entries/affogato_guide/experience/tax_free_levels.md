When spending experience, instead of spending experience in levels, experience is spent in the amount of experience points required to get to the level cost from zero experience.

Here's a practical example:
- You have 40 levels, and the level cost of an action is 5 levels.
  - In vanilla, you spend 5 levels flat, reducing your level to 35
  - With Tax Free Levels, you only spend the experience points required to get to level 5 from zero, reducing your level to 39
