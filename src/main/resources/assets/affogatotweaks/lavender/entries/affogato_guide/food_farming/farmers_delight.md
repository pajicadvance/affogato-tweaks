- Affogato food mechanics (and a few other aspects of gameplay) are balanced around the mod Farmer's Delight.
- You'll be expected to focus on making a steady supply of a variety of foods (see [How to Not Starve](^affogatotweaks:food_farming/how_to_not_starve)).

- If you're not already familiar with the mod in some capacity, check out the [Getting Started](https://github.com/vectorwing/FarmersDelight/wiki/Getting-Started) page on the mod wiki.
