- Caves in Affogato are completely **pitch black** when no light is present!
- However, light sources now have more practical uses to help you deal with the darkness.

;;;;;

- Holding a light source in your hand will emit light around you, and dropped light sources will also emit light. 
  - This means you can throw torches and other light sources to check how deep a cave or hole is.
- Lanterns can be worn in the Belt slot, and provide light at all times.
