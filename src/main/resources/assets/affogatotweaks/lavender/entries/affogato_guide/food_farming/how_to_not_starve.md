- Eating the same food item repeatedly will decrease its hunger and saturation restoration values.
- Food items with zero restoration value cannot be eaten until restored.
- Eating other food items will restore back some of the restoration value.

- This means that you have to **eat a variety of different food items in a cycle** in order to not waste hunger.
- Make use of the [Lunch Box](^affogatotweaks:food_farming/lunch_box) to help with food management and conserve inventory space.
- Sleeping will **drain your hunger overnight**. Make sure to have food prepared for when you wake up.
