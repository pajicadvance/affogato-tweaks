## This mod is included in my modpack, [Affogato](https://modrinth.com/modpack/affogato), and is specifically made for it. It probably doesn't make sense to be used anywhere else.

I published it here anyway for ease of management, and for the rare chance that someone else might find it useful for their project. I won't be documenting it here, but you can figure out what it does by the source code and the Affogato docs.
